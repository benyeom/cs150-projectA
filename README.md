## Thesis:
The PM2.5 concentration levels of 2024 have revealed a significant disparity in air pollution between the Fall and Spring semesters, potentially influencing negative first impressions of Westmont. Given this seasonal variation, we encourage those who had an unfavorable initial experience to remain for the following semester, allowing them to fully appreciate the improved air quality and vibrant lifestyle that Westmont and Santa Barbara have to offer.

## Context:
**Who**: Yearly Westmont Freshman pool who didn’t enjoy their first semester and are considering transferring to another school.

**What**: Air pollution based on particulate matter concentration levels in 2024 have projected to show an improvement during the months included in the Spring semester; please consider staying at Westmont.

**How**: Illustrate the significant difference between particulate matter concentration levels during the months of the Fall semester vs Spring semester. 

## Data: 
**CSV File in Root Directory**: assets/ad_viz_plotval_data.csv

**CSV File Used for Data Visualization**: https://www3.epa.gov/cgi-bin/broker?_service=data&_server=134.67.99.91&_port=4081&_sessionid=QAogJKobS52&_PROGRAM=dataprog.ad_viz_plotval_getdata.sas

## Strategies Used: 
* Employed white space in both my Plotly dash and presentation. 
* Margins remain free of text and visuals. 
* Visuals are not stretched to take up the available space; instead, appropriately sized to my content. 	
* The only thing on the page; a single sentence or even a single number. 
* All text in the visual is the same size except where decisions were made to further emphasize or de‐emphasize components. 
* The graph title is larger.
